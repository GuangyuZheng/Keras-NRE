# Neural Relation Extraction(NRE)
### This is a modified version, which is based on Keras with Tensorflow as backend.
### Original implementation: [BGRU+2ATT](https://github.com/thunlp/OpenNRE/tree/master/old)
Neural relation extraction aims to extract relations from plain text with neural models, which has been the state-of-the-art methods for relation extraction. In this project, we provide our implementations of a word-level and sentence-level combined Bidirectional GRU network (BGRU+2ATT).  

We come up with the idea from the paper "Attention-Based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks for Relation Classification" [Zhou et al.,2016] and the paper "Neural Relation Extraction with Selective Attention over Instances" [Lin et al.,2016]. And we compare our results with PCNN+ATT [Lin et al.,2016] on the same dataset.

# Data
We use the same dataset(NYT10) as in [Lin et al.,2016]. And we provide it in origin_data/ directory. NYT10 is originally released by the paper "Sebastian Riedel, Limin Yao, and Andrew McCallum. Modeling relations and their mentions without labeled text."  

Pre-Trained Word Vectors are learned from New York Times Annotated Corpus (LDC Data LDC2008T19), which should be obtained from LDC (https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T19). And we provide it also in the origin_data/ directory.

To run our code, the dataset should be put in the folder origin_data/ using the following format, containing four files
- train.txt: training file, format (fb_mid_e1, fb_mid_e2, e1_name, e2_name, relation, sentence).
- test.txt: test file, same format as train.txt.
- relation2id.txt: all relations and corresponding ids, one per line.
- vec.txt: the pre-train word embedding file

Before you train your model, you need to type the following command:  
`python3 initial.py`  
to transform the original data into .npy files for the input of the network. The .npy files will be saved in data/ directory.

# Codes
The source codes are in the current main directory. `network.py` contains the whole neural network's defination.

# Requirements
- Python (>=3.5)
- Keras (>=2.0.2)
- TensorFlow (>=r1.0)
- scikit-learn (>=0.18)
- Matplotlib (>=2.0.0)

# Train
### Unable to reproduce the training with small_train. (https://github.com/thunlp/TensorFlow-NRE/issues/7)
### Probably using full sized training data will work?
For training, you need to type the following command:  
`python3 train_GRU.py`  
The training model file will be saved in folder model/

# Test
For testing, you need to run the `test_GRU.py` to get all results on test dataset. BUT before you run it, you should change the pathname and modeliters you want to perform testing on in the test_GRU.py. We have add 'ATTENTION' to the code in `test_GRU.py` where you have to change before you test your own models.  

<!-- As an example, we provide our best model in the model/ directory. -->
You just need to type the following command:  
`python3 test_GRU.py`  
The testing results will be printed(mainly the P@N results and the area of PR curve) and the all results on test dataset will be saved in out/ directory.

To draw the PR curve for the sample model, you just need to type the following command:  
`python3 plot_pr.py`  
The PR curve will be saved as .png in current directory. If you want to plot the PR curve for your own model, you just need to change the modeliters in the `plot_pr.py` where we annotated 'ATTENTION'.
